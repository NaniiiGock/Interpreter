# MacTell: an LLM-Based Code Interpreter


## Overview
This application, developed in Swift for macOS, interfaces with a Large Language Model (LLM) backend to translate natural language user inputs into executable CLI commands to streamline user interactions.

- **Natural Language Processing:** Translates user inputs into executable CLI commands.
- **User Interaction Logging:** Implements an interaction logging mechanism for personalized command processing.
- **Swift-based GUI:** Provides an intuitive graphical user interface, enhancing user experience on macOS systems.
- **New Window:** Temporarily stores active session data.
- **Saved Window:** Permanently archives selected user interactions for saving and re-executing LLM-generated commands or responses.
